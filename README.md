# Home Assessment: To-Do List App

Objective: Create a simple application that allows users to manage a list of to-do tasks. This application should allow users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

## Basic Requirements:

### 1. User Interface:

- Display a list of tasks.
- Include buttons or UI elements to add a new task and delete existing ones.
- Each task should be able to be marked as completed with a visual indication.

### 2. Functionality:

- Add a task to the list with a simple text description.
- Delete a task from the list.
- Mark a task as completed, which should strike through the task text or change its color.

### 3. State Management:

- The application should maintain the state of the task list when navigating between different screens or after closing and reopening the app.

## Bonus (Optional):

### 1. Persistence:

- Save the task list to local storage and retrieve it on app start-up.

### 2. Validation:

- Implement input validation to ensure the task description is not empty.

### 3. UI Polish:

- Add some animations when adding/deleting tasks for a better user experience.

### 4. Testing:

- Write a simple unit test for one of the functions (e.g., adding a task, or deleting a task).
  Submission Instructions(Optional)
- Push your code to a public Git repository on GitHub and share the link.
- Include a README file with instructions on how to run the application and any other necessary documentation.
- If you completed any bonus tasks, mention these in your README.
  Evaluation Criteria:
- Code Quality: Is the code clean, well-organized, and properly commented?
- Functionality: Does the app meet the basic requirements set out in the task?
- User Interface: Is the UI intuitive and user-friendly?
- Problem Solving: How are edge cases handled, and how robust is the app against user input errors?
- (Optional) Bonus Features: Were any bonus features completed, and how well do they work?
  Notes for the Candidate:
- Focus on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- The UI doesn't need to be complex, but the app should be functional and free of bugs.
- Bonus features are optional but can be included to showcase additional skills
